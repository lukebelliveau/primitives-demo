Write a UI in React and view it on web, native, and Sketch. VR coming soon!

To get started, edit `example.js`. The default export of `example.js` is what will render to the platform of your choice.

To see your component in Sketch, open Sketch and run `yarn sketch`.

To see your component in a browser, run `yarn web` and point your browser to `localhost:3000`.

To see your component on your Android or iOS device, run `yarn native`. You'll need [Expo](https://expo.io/).

Inspired by the excellent [react-sketchapp](https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp)'s [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) demo.
