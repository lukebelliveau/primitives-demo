# primitives-demo
Demoing react-primitives &amp; styled-components on web, native, VR and sketch

To get started, edit `example.js`.

To see your component in Sketch, open Sketch and run `yarn sketch`.

To see your component in a browser, run `yarn web` and point your browser to `localhost:3000`.

To see your component on your Android or iOS device, run `yarn native`. You'll need [Expo](https://expo.io/).

Inspired by the excellent [react-sketchapp](https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp)'s [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) demo.
